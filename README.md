# PWEP-iOS

This repository outlines a post work program for iOS students participating in PWEP (Post Work Enrichment Program).

## Expectations

PWEP is about giving you one-on-one attention and more structure to prepare you to succeed in interviews and on the job. During PWEP, you will not be introduced to any employment opportunities through Flatiron's Career Services team, and you are discouraged from seeking leads on your own (for the time being). __The best thing you can do for yourself is focus on becoming a better programmer.__ If you succeed in that, the idea is that you will have a much better chance of capitalizing on an introduction / interview, and ultimately spend less time job hunting than you would had you not done PWEP.

PWEP is not punitive. We firmly believe that everyone can learn to program, and we are committed to helping you do so. The 12 week immersive course isn't much time and we know from experience that some students need a longer period to study. That’s ok, and we’re here for you through that period.

PWEP is self-paced. In the past, some students have finished their requirements in as little as 2 weeks. Others have taken a month or longer.

So what exactly does PWEP entail? There are four main components:

1. __A mid-sized project you will complete on your own__
2. __Blog posts every other week__
3. __Support via weekly check-ins with instructors__
4. __Weekly demo of your project__

## Getting Started

You will be assigned a selection of previous labs in preparation for the project. The topics covered in the labs are related to tasks you will encounter and implement in your project.

## Project

In the next few days, you will receive an outline of a project that you will build. It is designed to exercise all the major parts of an iOS app, and to mirror the sorts of problems you will receive in employer code challenges. Namely, it involves accessing an API, table views, collection views, a tab bar, loading images from the internet, and so on.

We will outline the major parts of the project on a Trello board, and provide associated labs and readings to assist you in completing each section of the app. We will be guiding you through the project on an individual basis (details to come later this week), and are available for questions.

Our goal is for this project to serve as a showpiece on your resume, and to reinforce important topics you may have missed during the beginning of the course or project mode.

*__Note:__ Students may choose to build a project of their own choosing instead of the outlined project mentioned above. It must fulfill the same criteria of the outlined project and be approved by instructors.*

## Blog Posts

Every other week, you must write, post, and submit a blog to an instructor. These blogs can be about anything technical (you may find the project to be a good source of posts). Writing blogs shows employers that you are dedicated to improving your craft, as well as willing to contribute to the community, making you a more desirable hire.

## Requirements

In addition to writing blogs, you must check in with instructors at least twice a week, either in-person or over video-chat (Video-chat is __not__ preferred because there is a threshold for effectiveness and sometimes it can be counterproductive). These two check-ins are your opportunity to share your progress with an instructor and ask any questions you may have. It also gives us the opportunity to assess your progress, offer instruction, reset priorities, etc.


You are encouraged to work on campus!

__The project, blog posts, and weekly check-ins with instructors are mandatory. These requirements are necessary to ensure your success and encourage you to demonstrate a continued commitment to building your skills. Upon successful completion of PWEP, you are eligible to begin working with the Career Services team.__


## Schedule

#### Monday (bi-weekly)
- 12 PM - Blogs are due at this time.
  - Write a technical blog, like you had done when class was in session.

#### Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday (2x weekly)
- Appointment (time) slots will be offered/scheduled week to week.
  - Check-ins should last between 30 min to an hour with one instructor.
  - We will make sure you’ve completed the tasks you set out to do on Trello.
  - You will step through your code with an instructor to go over the progress you made and to make sure you understand the code you’re writing.
  - Be prepared to recreate portions of your code.

#### Friday (weekly)
- Time TBD week to week.
  - You will be asked to demo your project.
  - This will be done in person.
  - You should be able to communicate clearly on what it is you worked on. This can be done by staying on top of your tasks in Trello and marking off what it is you’re currently working on and what you have completed.
  - Don’t show up with a broken app that doesn’t run.
